<h1>Summary of Important Concepts</h1>
<b>The Web and HTML</b>
<p>The World Wide Web is made of a Collection of HTML documents. 
HTML: HyperText Markup Language, is a language; HTML is made up of:
- text content: what you see
- markup: what it looks like. 
- references to other documents: like images, videos, and otehr files/documents.
- Links to other pages.

HyperLinks are what link all of these documents together, making the internet... web-like. There are more than 30 bn pages on the internet today.
</p>

<b>How it all fits together</b>
<p>The web is made of 4 major pieces:
Your computer and your browser: the browser being a software to make requests and display html documents on the user's computer.
The Internet: a computer network (the world's largest).
HTTP: the main protocol used on the web by web browsers to request files from servers.
Servers: computers (hardware) optimized for hosting the files that make up the web.

<em>The process:</em>
Your computer and your browser: make requests on the internet through HTTP protocol to servers. The servers respond by sending back the requested files to the browser, which displays this files on the user's computer.
</p>

<b>More HTML: Elements, tags, and attributes</b>
<p>HTML markup is what allows us to create HTML elements, where an element is content framed by both an opening and a tags.
HTML attribute can be added to an HTML tag. Attribute typically have values (like a URL for the a href attribute in an 'a tag'). Another important attribute is 'class' that can contain css language, to add style to your web page.</p>

<p><em>Inline and Block elements:</em>
These two HTML elements differ mainly in that Block elements create an 'invisible box' around their content, with both a height and a width; breaking down an HTML page. While the Inline elements just end a line in an HTML document.</p>

<b>General Concepts:</b>
<p><b>Technology Empathy:</b>
Computers are extremely sensitive to typos and human mistakes in writing the code, they are entirely dependent on the code - the instructions given by the user - to perform their tasks. This is what allows computers to perform extremely powerful and fast operations and tasks when used well.</p>

<p><b>Programers can't remember everything:</b>
It is more important to understand fundamental programming concepts rather than just memorize syntax that can be looked-up online.
